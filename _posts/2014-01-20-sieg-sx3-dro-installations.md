It never seizes to amaze me how its possible to find inspiration in improving on even the simplest of tasks just by seeing what other people have done. This post is curated compilation the notes I collected when planning the DRO installation ([X-axis](% post_url 2013-11-12-sx3-dro-xaxis %}) and [Y-axis](% post_url 2013-11-03-sx3-dro-yaxis %})) on my Sieg SX3 mill.

Almost all my projects include countless hours spent researching forums, blogs, and Youtube videos for _prior art_, to see what solutions other people have come up with to similar problems. If we all were to re-invent the wheel every time we started a new project, we would spend a lot of time not progressing.

From a commercial perspective this research is invaluable in identifying risks involved in the project such as spotting pitfalls upfront, assessing the machining operations involved, verifying that all tooling is available, and difficulties in sourcing materials and components.

A new project always starts out as a single document with notes, links to articles, small lists of requirements and specifications, etc. I use <http://www.evernote.com/>, there are countless other alternatives.

Fortunately for anyone planning to DRO a mill or a lathe, the companies selling DRO kits and components, invest a lot of effort in making a DRO installation accessible. Just take a look as the video collection by DRO Pros [on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/user/DROPROS?feature=watch).
