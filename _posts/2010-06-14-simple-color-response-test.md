This had been on my todo list for a long time. A comparison of the color response of different light sources.

Incandescent light bulbs have a color rendering index (CRI) of 100 whereas most artificial light sources have a CRI of 70-80, and even "high CRI" versions of artificial light sources only reach CRI values of 90-95. I'm making LED fixtures for a number of lamps around the house, and so I have been interested in finding out what the lower CRI values actually means in terms of color response,

I used an IT8 target as my reference. An IT8 target, is a color reference used to calibrate the color profiles of digital imaging equipment such as digital cameras and scanners. The sensors and optical filters in digital imaging equipment is more sensitive to certain colors, and so a calibrated color reference photo is used to compensate for this non-linearity.

This characteristic of color imaging equipment is very much similar to the behaviour of artificial light sources that often emit much more light at certain wave lengths (as does fluorescent tubes) or certain bands of wave lengths.
