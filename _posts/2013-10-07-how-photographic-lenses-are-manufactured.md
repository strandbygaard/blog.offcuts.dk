I've always been very fond of detailed and illustrated descriptions of how different manufacturing processes work. The show ["How It's Made"](http://science.discovery.com/tv-shows/how-its-made) has always been a favourite of mine.

Being very interested in photography, I read a lot of photo related web sites, and came across [this](http://www.imaging-resource.com/news/2013/09/19/a-geeks-tour-of-sigmas-aizu-lens-factory-precision-production-from-the-insi) excellent article on Imaging Resource on how photographic lenses are made.

It provides a good commentary with a lots of excellent close-ups of the complex machinery involved in the mostly automated manufacturing processes to produce the lenses that [Sigma](http://www.sigmaphoto.com/) sells.

This manufacturing process is interesting, in that it also involves machining glass. Most articles and Youtube videos , etc., are about machining different kinds of metals so the challenges involved in machining glass is a nice addition. Take a look at this grinder:
