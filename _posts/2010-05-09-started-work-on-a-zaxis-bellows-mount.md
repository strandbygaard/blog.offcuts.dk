title: Started Work On A Z-axis Bellows Mount

Milling operations generate a lot of swarf, and cleaning up gets old really fast, so I've started a project to mount a bellows on the Z-axis of the Sieg SX3 mill.

IMHO bellows are an ideal swarf protection for the Z-axis. The mounting areas - mill head and base - are well defined and accessible, mounting a bellows doesn't limit range of travel, and fully closed there is still enough of the ways exposed to "guide" the bellows.
