I usually don't subscribe to Youtube channels. [AWE me](http://www.youtube.com/user/AweMeChannel/videos?view=0) is one of the rare exceptions, and the only reason is to track the truly amazing creations from [Tony Swatton](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1044149/) of [Sword and the Stone](http://www.swordandstone.com/the-show).

Every week he posts a video showing the creation of a sword. The videos are short (< 10min), concise, and of great quality being produced by a professional production company. The videos are not 	detailed walkthroughs of the processes involved. Rather they are motion picture presentations of the creation with much emphasis on the entertainment value. Which is wholly fine with me. Definitely worth my precious time. 

The craftsmanship, quality, and attention to detail that is shown is truly amazing.
