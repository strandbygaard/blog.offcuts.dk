A small clamp I designed for a typical Chinese style "precision milling vise". It's designed to be machined from a 40mm length of 25mm square tool steel rod, and is fixed using an M10 hex cap screw. The original Google Sketchup file is [attached]({{ site.url }}/assets/files/2010-04-01-clamp-for-milling-vice/milling-vice-clamp.skp).
