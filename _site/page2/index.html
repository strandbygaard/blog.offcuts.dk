<h3>Bottom Bracket</h3>

<p>I made the bottom bracket from a single piece of aluminum measuring 75x235x15mm. In this a slot for the Z-axis way is cut and holes are drilled in the bottom for press fitting the magnets that will fix the bracket to the mill base.</p>

<p>Cutting a piece 240mm long from existing bar stock. Even with a brand new bi-metal blade and plenty of WD-40 that is still quite a chore. Time to start saving for that band saw!</p>

<p><img src="/images/2010-06-18-zaxis-bellows-mount-part3/20100618-230000.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>Squaring the edges of the sawed of piece. Another downside to using a manual hack saw is that the saw cut tends to be quite at quite an angle from vertical, hence the need to remove a lot of material before the edge is square.</p>

<p>Here I&#39;m using a 10mm 4-flute end mill where the end is damaged. It&#39;s certainly not ideal for this type of operation, but squaring ends is purely for cosmetic reasons - the finish and dimensions of the edges are in no way critical - so I decided to save the wear on my other end mills for more critical applications.</p>

   <div class="date">Monday, 14 June 2010 03:08:00 CEST</div>
   <div>
    <p>This had been on my todo list for a long time. A comparison of the color response of different light sources.</p>

<p>Incandescent light bulbs have a color rendering index (CRI) of 100 whereas most artificial light sources have a CRI of 70-80, and even &quot;high CRI&quot; versions of artificial light sources only reach CRI values of 90-95. I&#39;m making LED fixtures for a number of lamps around the house, and so I have been interested in finding out what the lower CRI values actually means in terms of color response,</p>

<p>I used an IT8 target as my reference. An IT8 target, is a color reference used to calibrate the color profiles of digital imaging equipment such as digital cameras and scanners. The sensors and optical filters in digital imaging equipment is more sensitive to certain colors, and so a calibrated color reference photo is used to compensate for this non-linearity.</p>

<p>This characteristic of color imaging equipment is very much similar to the behaviour of artificial light sources that often emit much more light at certain wave lengths (as does fluorescent tubes) or certain bands of wave lengths.</p>

   <div class="date">Thursday, 20 May 2010 01:47:00 CEST</div>
   <div>
    <p>Ever since the SX3 arrived, I&#39;ve been wanting a real milling vice. My 80mm screwless precision vice (something like <a href="/images/2010-05-19-vertex-va4-Finally-Arrived/20100520-090800.jpg">this</a>) is adequate for small stuff, but chatter is a significant problem with it, and it shows on the finish. I&#39;ve spent a lot of time searching the Internet for the best one I could afford, a finally decided on the Vertex VA-4. I&#39;ve written more about the selection process here.</p>

<p>The VA-4 is much more massive than my precision vice and at 20kg vs 6kg for the precision vice it&#39;s a completely different weight class. I really need to make a side-by-side comparison picture to show the true difference.</p>

<p>The make and finish of the VA-4 is very nice for a Chinese knock-off (the &quot;real deal&quot; is a 4&quot; Kurt angle-lock vice). Finish is much greater than what I&#39;ve seen for other Chinese Kurt-style vices, but it&#39;s not on par with the make and finish of my screwless precision vice. My own general rule for machine tools is that you pay a standard price per kg with the actual price per kg depending on the overall quality, and at 4x the weight but only twice the cost of my screwless vice the VA-4 should be about half as nice in make and finish, and that seems about right.</p>

<p><a href="/2010/05/11/zaxis-bellows-mount-part1">Part 1, Introduction</a></p>

<h3>Top Bracket</h3>

<p>The top bracket is made of two pieces of aluminum. A smaller bar that holds three magnets, and fixes to the milling head between the tilting head mount and the vertical column, and a wider plate screwed to this bar and to which the top part of the bellows is attached.</p>

<p>First step in making the small part of the top bracket is to cut a piece of aluminum 20x15x140mm. I used 6082 but any alloy will do.</p>

<p>Layout scribe marks for drilling the holes for the magnets. </p>

<p>Note that the right mark is off center from the other two marks to make room for the bottom screw securing the z-axis gib. Also, a small recess for the screw head has been milled in the top right corner of the aluminum bar.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2010-05-18-zaxis-bellows-mount-part2/20100518-230000.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>Drilling holes for the magnets in the small bar.</p>

<p>The magnets are round measuring 10mm in diameter and 10mm in length. They will be press fitted in the top bar so the holes are drilled using a 9,9mm drill.</p>

<p>The finish and hole concentricity doesn&#39;t really matter in this case, so I didn&#39;t bother center drilling or gradually opening up the hole size. I drilled directly to size using plenty of WD-40. The downside to this approach, as can be seen in the image, is the tangle of aluminum swarf.</p>

<p>The max spindle speed of the SX3 is 1800rpm which is not nearly enough to break the chips in drilling operations.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2010-05-18-zaxis-bellows-mount-part2/20100518-230001.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>The finished piece that will hold the magnets in the top bracket.</p>

<p>Each magnet yields a 6,5kg pull, and it remains to be seen if this is adequate to keep the bracket in place when the bellows is fully extended.</p>

   <div class="date">Wednesday, 12 May 2010 16:06:00 CEST</div>
   <div>
    <p>That was probably the most pressing question I wanted answered, when I got a mill. And the answer seems to be 0,01mm if your very careful.</p>

<p>Not the accuracy of the mill itself - I felt very sure, that straight out of the crate, the mill would be way out of tram, and that certainly was the case! Rather, given a properly trammed mill, to what tolerances should I be able to machine stuff? Give and take how many tenths, hundreds or thousandths of a millimeter should I reliably be able to produce a part of a certain length, width, or height?</p>

<p>Part of the answer was pretty straight forward. Commonly available - and affordable - measuring instruments (calipers, micrometers, height gauges) have a resolution of 0,01mm (digital micrometers and some dial indicators resolve to 0,001mm) and with a repeatability of about 0,03mm - so the answer is at least close to those numbers.</p>

<p>The other part of the answer was found in <a href="http://www.cnccookbook.com/CCMetrologyTooling.html">this</a> very excellent categorization over at <a href="http://www.cnccookbook.com/">CNCCookbook</a> of which measurement instruments are usable when working towards different tolerances, and his personal notes on what tolerances he can achieve on his IH mill (a very nice RF-45 clone) given 10 years of experience.</p>

<p>Straight out of the crate, the column of my SX3 was 0,6mm out of tram over a range of 250mm side-to-side. My target for tramming the column is 0,01mm over 150mm.</p>

<p><a href="/2010/05/09/started-work-on-a-zaxis-bellows-mount">Started Work On A Z-axis Bellows Mount</a></p>

<p>Milling operations generate a lot of swarf, that tend to get into every possible nook and cranny. The Sieg SX3 is a great machine for what it is, but at that price point there are many compromises and omissions, and one of them is proper swarf protection, especially for the ways.</p>

<p>Consequently, most everyone owing a Sieg mini mill and other Chinese benchtop mills end up devising a number of guards and covers to keep swarf from getting into table ways and other unwanted places. My initial approach was a simple Plexiglas shield to keep swarf away from the table and ways. This helped quite a lot, but I decided that something more was needed. </p>

<p><img src="/images/2010-05-11-zaxis-bellows-mount-part1/20100511-230000.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>The first part was a bellows cover for the Z-axis mounted using two custom aluminum brackets and 8 rare-earth magnets to keep everything in place. By using magnets for non-critical applications like a bellows mount I avoid drilling and tapping any unnecessary wholes in the mill.</p>

<p>The Google Sketchup drawing I used for the design is attached. I ended up making many minor corrections that weren&#39;t brought back into the drawings, but these were mostly to improve the overall fit. The drawings will work as-is.</p>

<h3>Cost</h3>

<p>The project ended up costing $60. Cheap quality bellows like <a href="http://www.arceurotrade.co.uk/Catalogue/Machine-Spares/Machine-Bellows/Concertina-Bellows-300mm-x-200mm---Dip-Moulded-Rubber-084-030-00300">this</a> can be had for just $10, but I decided that since this would become a permanent part of the machine, I wanted a nicer solution. Overlapping metal way covers are the ideal solution, but that project is pretty involved, so instead I opted for a better quality bellow. Since I live in Europe my options are pretty limited, but Arc Euro Trade carries a <a href="http://www.arceurotrade.co.uk/Catalogue/Machine-Spares/Machine-Bellows/Concertina-Bellows-240mm-x-50mm---Laminated-Fabric-084-030-00100">nice version</a> that is almost tailor made for the Z-axis way on the SX3. It does, however, cost nearly $40. Add another $10 for the magnets and $10 for the three pieces of aluminum.</p>

    <p>Milling operations generate a lot of swarf, and cleaning up gets old really fast, so I&#39;ve started a project to mount a bellows on the Z-axis of the Sieg SX3 mill.</p>

<p>IMHO bellows are an ideal swarf protection for the Z-axis. The mounting areas - mill head and base - are well defined and accessible, mounting a bellows doesn&#39;t limit range of travel, and fully closed there is still enough of the ways exposed to &quot;guide&quot; the bellows.</p>
