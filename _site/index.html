   <div class="date">Thursday, 07 November 2013 07:00:00 CET</div>
   <div>
    <p>A high output, totally flexible, machine tool light, that costs only $50, and can be built and mounted in 15 minutes. </p>

<p>Seems too good to be true, but after I have been through a number of iterations on improving lighting on my mill, that is what I ended up with.</p>

<p><img src="/images/project-sx3-light/20131105-011504.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>When I got my <a href="/2010/03/26/the-sieg-sx3-has-arrived">Sieg SX3</a> I first mounted a small goose neck lamp with a 14W halogen reflector spot in an E14 mount. This worked fairly well, but didn&#39;t quite deliver enough illumination, and the emitted infrared heat from the lamp has annoying when working close to the lamp. Also, during extended periods, the lamp became fairly hot to the touch, so care had to be exerted not to touch the lamp. In short, a decent solution but with room for improvement.</p>

<p>Next up, was a small 3W LED lamp with a long goose neck. This lamp output less lumens than the first solution, but in a more tightly focused beam, and with the longer goose neck and smaller lamp head, it was easier to manoeuvre into place to provide the illumination where it was actually needed in relation to a specific cut, and avoid unwanted shadows. Given the low wattage emitted and built up heat was not an issue.</p>

<p>Both attempts were hastily put together to provide just some kind of illumination close to the spindle. I finally decided I needed to improve this, since I find proper illumination to make a huge difference in my work.</p>

<p>By chance I found some cool looking 10W and up LED lamps meant as work lights on tractors, trucks, ATVs, etc., and they seemed to be perfectly suited for this task:</p>

<ol>
<li>High lumens output</li>
<li>Selection of flood or spot light</li>
<li>Sealed to IP67 to provide good protection from &quot;the elements&quot;. Here, that would be chips, coolant, etc.</li>
<li>Efficiency comparable to compact fluorescent lamps, which watt-to-watt is a 2x improvement over halogen bulbs.</li>
<li>It can be powered from any number of &quot;wall warts&quot; I already had lying around</li>
</ol>

<p>Next up, I needed a flexible way of mounting the LED lamp on the mill (and other machine tools). The goose necks from my previous attempts were not going to carry the weight of the LED lamp head, so a different solution with the same manoeuvrability was needed.</p>

<p>I ended up with a universal magnetic stand for a dial indicator. The reach of the arm was somewhat less than I had hoped for, but other than that it seemed like the perfect solution:</p>

<ol>
<li>The magnetic base provided great freedom of placement on the mill (or any other machine tool), and plenty of holding force</li>
<li>The single locking mechanism on the arm, made it a comfortable two-hand operation to position the lamp head and lock it into place. No wishing for a third hand.</li>
<li>It was cheap</li>
</ol>

<h3>Built</h3>

<p>This is the BOM I ended up with:</p>

<ol>
<li>LED lamp ($20)</li>
<li>An M4 stainless cap screw bolt</li>
<li>Two M4 washers</li>
<li>An M4 nut to go on the bolt</li>
<li>Universal magnetic stand ($30)</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/images/project-sx3-light/20131105-005737.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>And this is what the kit looks like put together. I opted for a flood beam LED light, because I only have a small mill and the lamp head will be mounted in close proximity to the spindle. For larger machines or other situations where the lamp head is mounted further away from the action, I would recommend a spot beam shape.</p>

<p><img src="/images/project-sx3-light/20131105-010259.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>I&#39;m going to add a spot beam lamp to my setup, and move the flood lamp a little further away, to get good overall lighting of the work area, and concentrated illumination of the cutting action.</p>

<p>It is difficult to capture the level of light provided by the lamp. The dynamic range of this on-screen image is much less than what the human eye can discern, and is generally limited with the color depth of the display or print technology.</p>

<p><img src="/images/project-sx3-light/20131105-011313.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>I do think this image captures the provided illumination fairly well, in relation to the overall lighting of the surroundings in my workshop, which is already very well illuminated with white walls and ceilings, and 200W of installed fluorescent overhead lighting in an area of just 12 m2.</p>

   <h2><a href="/2013/11/03/sx3-dro-yaxis">DRO Mount (Y-axis) on Sieg SX3</a></h2>
   <div class="date">Sunday, 03 November 2013 07:00:00 CET</div>
   <div>
    <p>There are many posts about DRO installation on a bench top mill. This is yet another one.</p>

<p>This post details how I installed DRO on the Y-axis of my <a href="/2010/03/26/the-sieg-sx3-has-arrived">Sieg SX3</a>. Unlike most other builds I&#39;ve seen, I elected to use magnetic tape, instead of the usual plunger- or optical scales.</p>

<p>Magnetic tape and encoder has several advantages over optical scales (which in turn are better than plungers): </p>

<ol>
<li>The magnetic tape mounted in an aluminium profile is much more robust than an optical scale</li>
<li>Both scale and encoder head are fully sealed to IP67 which makes them much more resilient to the harsh environment on a mill</li>
<li>The required aluminium profile and magnetic encoder head are much smaller than a comparable optical system, making them easer to fit in tight spaces</li>
</ol>

<p>Since I live in Denmark, the selection of readily available DRO systems is much smaller than in the states. I selected a system from <a href="http://www.machine-dro.co.uk">Allendale Electronics Ltd.</a>, and they provided excellent support on selecting suitable components for my specific mill.</p>

<p>Of course this comes at a price, and a full DRO system using magnetic tape and encoders is around 20% more expensive than a comparable system using optical scales. Also, while the magnetic encoders have a resolution of 1 micron (0.001mm), their accuracy is only +/- 0.015mm whereas typical optical encoders have an accuracy of +/- 0.005mm, and this may be a deal breaker for some.</p>

<p>I doubt the Sieg SX3 is capable of repeatedly working to such tolerances, and the temperature variations in my workshop are certainly much too great for that level of accuracy. Also, the prototypes I make usually only need to hold &quot;look good&quot; tolerances, typically within 0.08-0.1mm. So, I prioritised the practical benefits of a system based on magnetic encoders, and I&#39;ve been very happy with it so far.</p>

<h3>Installation</h3>

<p>Using a dial indicator to level the aluminium profile holding the magnetic tape.</p>

<p><img src="/images/project-sx3-dro/20130929-215311.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>The mounting holes in the aluminium profile was used to transfer the hole locations to the Y-axis saddle. The holes in the aluminium profile has recessed hole for the screw heads. The OD of a 13mm hole transfer punch fits perfectly in this recess.</p>

<p>The transferred holes are then drilled to Ø3.2mm.</p>

<p><img src="/images/project-sx3-dro/20130929-221612.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>The drilled holes are tapped with an M4 tap. There was no room for a tap guide, and an M4 tap is easy to snap, so I used a new taps, separate rougher, intermediate, and finisher taps, and plenty of cutting paste to prevent tap breakage. The Y-axis saddle is cast iron which is actually very easy to tap, and yields very clean and well defined threads.</p>

<p><img src="/images/project-sx3-dro/20130929-224526.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>This is a test mount to check for fit of the aluminium profile. As can be seen, it has not been cut to size yet. The extrusion is mounted with M4 screws, but the pre-cut holes in the profile are Ø6mm, so they allow for plenty of play to compensate for off-centre mounting holes, and any fine adjustments to level the extrusion.</p>

<p>I used the Y-axis saddle as guide to scribe lines where the profile will be cut to length.</p>

<p><img src="/images/project-sx3-dro/20130929-225049.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>After the profile is cut to length, the dial indicator setup is again used to level the profile on the Y-axis saddle.</p>

<p><img src="/images/project-sx3-dro/20130929-231440.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>The profile mounted with cover holding the magnetic tape.</p>

<p><img src="/images/project-sx3-dro/20130929-232532.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>Next, a bracket is made, that will hold the magnetic encoder head. It is just a simple aluminium angle bracket with 4 holes. Two for mounting to the mill base, and two for holding the encoder head.</p>

<p><img src="/images/project-sx3-dro/20131011-113138.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>The bracket was used to again transfer the hole locations to the mill base using a hole punch. The angle bracket does not provide a very good guide for the hole punch, so afterwards it was necessary to shape the mounting holes in the bracket with a needle file. Slightly annoying, but it has no practical implications.</p>

<p>After the holes were transferred they were drilled with Ø4.3mm and tapped using M5 rougher, intermediate, and finisher taps. The mill base cast is only about 12mm thick, so it was an easy through-hole tap, even though there wasn&#39;t room for a tapping guide. </p>

<p>In retrospect, I could easily have used a finisher tap directly, since the cast iron is very easy to cut, and a broken tap would have been easy to remove. However, I approach all modifications I make on existing (=expensive) equipment as one-shot-only, and so I take the long approach of tap forming.</p>

<p><img src="/images/project-sx3-dro/20131011-122756.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>Here, the bracket is mounted and the magnetic encoder head is installed on the bracket. Clearance between the encoder head and the profile must be between 0.1-1.00mm, so I used a 0.5mm feeler gauge to set the distance.</p>

<p><img src="/images/project-sx3-dro/20131011-130102.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>A different view of the final installation. I find that the magnetic tape and encoder gives a very clean and tight installation. It avoids the extensive angle bracket and mounting on the side of the mill base, and it employes the mill table as a natural chip shield.</p>

<p>The magnetic tape is impervious to coolant and chips, and the encoder head itself is protected to IP67 so in principal, a chip shield is not necessary. However, I think that chips could easily get stuck in the tight clearance between the encoder head and profile holding the magnetic tape, and so I believe that a chip shield is still necessary.</p>

<p><img src="/images/project-sx3-dro/20131011-133749.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>And this is what the full thing looks like :-)</p>

   <h2><a href="/2013/10/05/pellet-trap-part2">An Improved Pellet Trap (part 2)&#58; Design</a></h2>
   <div class="date">Saturday, 05 October 2013 08:00:00 CEST</div>
   <div>
    <h3>Previous Posts</h3>

<p><a href="/2013/09/19/pellet-trap-part1">Part 1, Reasoning</a></p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>The design of the pellet trap I&#39;m building is fairly simple, using a combination of friction and impact to stop pellets. First, a replaceable layer of 3mm PVC plastic will use friction to decelerate the pellets, and then two layers of 12mm polyurethane (PUR) sheet will use impact to stop the pellets.</p>

<p>I&#39;m fairly happy with this design, as it meets most of my design goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&#39;s low maintenance. The PVC sheet will need replacing from time to time, but not too often. The PUR sheet  should last a very very long time, especially when using wad cutters at no more than 12J.</li>
<li>It&#39;s quiet. The impact with the PVC sheet will be audible, but much less so than most other materials like wood, hard plastic, or steel.</li>
<li>It&#39;s cheap. Only small amounts of PVC and PUR sheet is required, and the cost per m2 of these materials is low.</li>
</ul>

<p>The one property of the design that I&#39;m not too happy about is, that PVC and PUR sheet is fairly difficult to come by in the small quantities required - and whole reel of PVC does cost a lot of money. Patches of conveyer belt can work just as well as PUR, so depending on your geographical location, this may be easier to come by. I have yet to find an alternative to PVC. </p>

<p>The main advantages of PVC is that it heals (closes) really well and that no material is &quot;removed&quot; on pellet strike. No other materials I&#39;ve looked at close anywhere near as good and they leave a big mess. Common materials used such as patches of carpet, news paper, phonebooks, and cloth, they don&#39;t &quot;close&quot; the whole after a pellet strikes (carpet and cloth does to a limited extent) and over time they make a mess from the trace materials they leave on pellet strike.</p>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Bullet traps in general are based on one of three principles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Impact</li>
<li>Friction</li>
<li>Deceleration</li>
</ul>

<p>Impact and friction designs are much simpler than a deceleration design, and maybe as a consequence, no commercially sold pellet trap is based on this design. A pellet carry much less energy than a bullet fired from a firearm, and is thus much easier to stop, which also detracts from using a deceleration design.</p>

<p>Because of the inherent &quot;klang&quot; from a pellet trap based on an impact design, I decided the design also needed to incorporate a friction element, to reduce the energy of the final impact strike. With a deceleration design, there will still be a pellet strike, and probably also a &quot;klang&quot;.</p>

<p>Many people are reporting that the &quot;klang&quot; from most pellet traps can effectively be suppressed using some form of moderator (cloth, foam, insulation, etc.), however there is still the risk of lead dust to consider.</p>

<p>Friction style bullet traps, in general, are typically based on one of the following designs:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sand berm</li>
<li>Rubber berm (same as sand berm, but using rubber granule)</li>
<li>Sheets of material</li>
</ul>

<p>The sand berm is a fantastic engineering solution. Cheap, very effective, and &quot;self-reorganizing&quot; so it overcomes the inherent problem of concentrated high energy impacts. Use of rubber granule was inspired by the sand berm. A material was needed that had the same properties as sand, but made separating material from bullets easier. </p>

<p>Action Target has made a very good analysis of berms made from rubber granule (<a href="http://www.actiontarget.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/Myths-About-Rubber-Bullet-Traps.pdf">original link</a>) and <a href="/files/2013-09-21-pellet-trap-part2/Myths-About-Rubber-Bullet-Traps.pdf">local copy</a>.</p>

<p>The US Army also did an extensive study on commercially sold bullet traps, and it&#39;s an excellent walkthrough of different design principles and the associated pros and cons. Here&#39;s the (<a href="https://www.google.dk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;ved=0CEwQFjAE&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dtic.mil%2Fcgi-bin%2FGetTRDoc%3FAD%3DADA308438&amp;ei=91c9UqrwBImI4AT5mYHoCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNEHWoDjVvsbwOO2pzbwEGPjMAk7HA&amp;sig2=TdUHBCYaFxj8JhLfPKHSdw&amp;bvm=bv.52434380,d.bGE">original link through Google</a>) as well as <a href="/files/2013-09-21-pellet-trap-part2/ADA308438.pdf">local copy</a>.</p>

   <h2><a href="/2013/09/19/pellet-trap-part1">An Improved Pellet Trap (part 1)&#58; Reasoning</a></h2>
   <div class="date">Thursday, 19 September 2013 22:00:00 CEST</div>
   <div>
    <p>When I recently needed an airgun pellet trap for practicing concentration and trigger pull indoors, I expected that a Google search would make quick work of a workable solution. Not so!</p>

<p>I had devised a list of functional- and non-functional requirements:</p>

<p><strong>Functional requirements</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Pellet sizes: 4,5mm (0.177) and 5,5mm</li>
<li>Pellet shapes: Flat and domed</li>
<li>Pellet energy design envelope: &lt; 16J (12FPE)</li>
<li>Pellet energy safety envelope: &lt; 50J</li>
<li>Expected range: 0-10m</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Non-functional requirements</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Can be used indoors</li>
<li>Quiet</li>
<li>Free of lead dust</li>
<li>Small, light, and portable</li>
<li>Easy to clean spent pellets</li>
<li>Low maintenance</li>
<li>Cheap in use</li>
</ul>

<p>A pellet trap poses an interesting engineering challenge: Absorbing thousands of concentrated high energy impacts.</p>

<p>An angled steel plate is a seemingly perfect solution: Simple, cheap, effective, easy to make. Unfortunately, it produces lead dust at impact speeds surpassing 200m/s, so indoor use really is limited to low power air guns. And, even worse, there is that never ending &quot;klang&quot; on pellet impact. That significantly reduces the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wife_acceptance_factor">WAF factor</a> :-)</p>

<p>Another, maybe even more seemingly perfect solution, has been devised: The sand berm. </p>

<p>In addition to all the qualities of the angled steel plate, it&#39;s a beatiful engineering solution to the problem of absorbing concentrated impacts: It self organizes. Unfortunately, a sand berm takes up a lot of room. It doesn&#39;t take a lot to stop an airgun pellet, but to have an acceptable height, it needs to be big. An then there&#39;s the whole mess of having it indoors.</p>

<p>It quickly became apparent, that all pellet traps being sold are in some way based on an angled steel plate, and so a different solution had to be sought.</p>

<p>The go-to solution for an improved pellet trap seems to be variations on the <a href="http://www.archerairguns.com/Premium-Silent-Pellet-Trap-p/aapeltrpnoputty.htm">&quot;Silent&quot; Pellet Trap</a>. In addition to being simple, effective, and easy to make, it&#39;s also quiet and free of lead dust. It seems perfect.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the magic ingreedient in that solution - Duct Seal -  is far from cheap in Denmark where I live. The 6kg which a pellet trap with duct seal typically requires, is almost $200 here :-(</p>

<p>So, instead I decided to build an improved pellet trap that would satisfy my requirements.</p>

    <p>A dial test indicator is used for so many things, that listing them all doesn&#39;t make sense. For example, accurately squaring your milling vice without one is next to impossible. And starting around  €25 it&#39;s one of the first accessories you should buy.</p>

<p>The cheap Chinese versions are typically sold in a kit with a magnetic stand. Do get such a kit, because it&#39;s cheap and because the stand is nice to have for other things. But instead of using the dial test indicator with the magnetic stand, get an Indicol holder and mount it in that.</p>

<p><img src="/images/2013-09-18-dial-indicator/20130918-200000.jpg" alt="this"></p>

<p>The Indicol holder makes it easy to attach the dial test indicator to just about any tool holder mounted in the mill spindle, and this arrangement is by far the best way to square a milling vice to the table and tram the mill column. Those two applications alone, make the Indicol holder worth getting, but it has numerous other uses.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s cheap! Just €15 ($20) for the Indicol holder, which really makes me wonder why there are no kits including one of these.</p>

<p>Dial test indicators have a swivel lever arm, whereas a dial indicator has a plunge lever. I find more different uses for the dial test indicator and so my recommendation would be to get one of those before you get a dial indicator. However, in setups they are interchangeable and so personal preference comes into play.</p>

<p>An excellent resource for everything related to dial indicators is <a href="http://longislandindicator.com/">Long Island Indicator Service</a> that specialize in servicing [quality] dial indicators. Dial indicators are high precision mechanical instruments that need maintenance, and the high cost warrant repairs rather than replacements. Their focus is obviously on quality indicators, and not the cheap Chinese tools, but they have a lot of good information, and since a &quot;quality&quot; dial test indicator starts at €130 ($170), it&#39;s one of the accessories where many will opt for the &quot;real thing&quot;.</p>

   <h2><a href="/2010/07/14/simple-color-response-test">Simple Color Response Test (Method & Results)</a></h2>
   <div class="date">Wednesday, 14 July 2010 22:00:00 CEST</div>
   <div>
    <p>I&#39;m researching application of white LED&#39;s as a replacement for interior lightning, and as part of that I need to answer two qualitative parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>How many lumens of LED light is needed to replace an 11W CFL bulb and a 20W halogen spot</li>
<li>Is the color response of LED&#39;s acceptable (and where isn&#39;t it)</li>
</ul>

<p>This small test is my initial effort to address the latter. This test has three purposes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Demonstrate the viability of the testing method</li>
<li>Indication of color response for two different white LED&#39;s</li>
<li>Indication of color response for fluorescent tubes and CFL bulb</li>
</ul>

<p>With a background in computer science and electrical engineering, I have no theoretical foundation to base my tests on, and the perception of color response is very subjective (just look at some of the threads on <a href="http://www.candlepowerforums.com/">Candlepowerforums</a>). The purpose of this test is not to give authoritative statements on applicability of specific lighting technologies, but to find something I like to look at every day. I&#39;ve always favored cold color temperatures - even halogen light appears yellow to me, and warm white CFL appears greenish - and that, I suspect, will strongly influence my preference.</p>

<p>An additional area I also want to investigate is whether a mix of cold and warm white LED&#39;s produce better color response, and if so a rough indication of the ratio of emitters. I realize that mixing red emitters with cold white emitters is probably a better strategy, but my red emitters are still on their way from Hong Kong, so that test will have to wait. </p>

<h3>Testing Method</h3>

<p>The test was conducted by placing an <a href="http://www.targets.coloraid.de/">IT8.7/2</a> target in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightbox">light box</a> with the light source on left side of the light box. The camera was mounted on a tripod. Shutter speed was kept constant and an aperture was selected according to the light source. The camera white balance was set to 6300K, and shots were recorded in both jpg and raw.</p>

<p>For this test I used a reflective IT8.7 target printed on Kodak professional paper, because I had trouble fitting the bigger non-reflective A4 version in my light box. This really isn&#39;t ideal, as that IT8.7 is intended for flatbed scanners, not cameras. This would be relevant if I was to use the results to create a color response correction profile for the camera and/or light source, but in this application I don&#39;t think it makes a difference. The brain does a ton psychological &quot;processing&quot; anyway. </p>

<p>The target of this test was a cheap superflux LED (brand and type unknown) I&#39;ve sourced in England. I expect them to perform much worse than a quality high power emitter from e.g. Cree or Seoul. For the LED light I wired 3x18 of the superflux LED&#39;s (2x18 cold white and 1x18 warm white), allowing ratios of 1:1 and 2:1 between cold white and warm white.</p>

<h3>Post Processing</h3>

<p>For this test, image post processing was done on the jpg&#39;s in Google Picasa. I&#39;ll redo the post processing in GIMP in a more controlled fashion on the RAW versions when time permits.</p>

<p>Two post processing steps were done:</p>

<ul>
<li>Images were cropped to show just the IT8 target</li>
<li>Neutral point was set to the neutral grey reference on the IT8 target, to correct for difference in color temp between the light sources</li>
</ul>

<p>I don&#39;t really know what selecting neutral point in Picasa actually does. Picasa simplifies everything so it might do some further processing I&#39;m now aware about (hence the need to repeat in GIMP to make sure), but judging by the results it does what I expected.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>The processed images are the results: Select which one you like the most. For each image I&#39;ve provided a link to the non temperature corrected version.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t quite decided on a satisfactory explanation for the corrected color response of #1 and #2. If I didn&#39;t now otherwise, I&#39;d have expected #1 to be from the warm white LED, but it&#39;s not! I&#39;ve redone the test several times to make sure, and my results can easily be verified by using the non-corrected copy of the image where the color temperature of the warm white emitter is very visible. Anyone care to comment?</p>
